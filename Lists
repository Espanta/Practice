alist
=======
alist.append(x)
Inserts the single object x at the end of alist, changing the list in-place.

alist.extend(x)
Inserts each item in any iterable x at the end of alist in- place (an in-place +). Similar to alist[len(alist):] = list(x).

alist.sort(key=None, reverse=False)
Sorts alist in-place, in ascending order by default. If passed, key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract or compute a comparison value from each list element. If reverse is passed and true, the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed. For ex- ample: alist.sort(key=str.lower, reverse=True). See also the sorted() built-in function.

alist.reverse()
Reverses items in alist in-place.

alist.index(x [, i [, j]])
Returns the index of the first occurrence of object x in alist; raises an exception if not found. This is a search method. If i and j are passed, it returns the smallest k such thats[k] == xandi <= k < j.

alist.insert(i, x)
Inserts object x into alist at offset i (like alist[i:i] = [x], for positive i).

alist.count(x)
Returns the number of occurrences of x in alist.

alist.remove(x)
Deletes the first occurrence of object x from alist; raises an exception if not found. Same as del alist[alist.index(x)].
